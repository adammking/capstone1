<h1 class="mt-3">What is Depression?</h1>
    <p> 
        Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest.
        According to the latest results of the 
        <a href=https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/cbhsq-reports/NSDUHNationalFindingsReport2018/NSDUHNationalFindingsReport2018.pdf>National Survey on Drug Use and Health</a> (2018), 
        17.7 million (7.2%) of American adults experienced a major depressive episode.
        There are many symptoms that could indicate an individual is experiencing a depressive episode.</p>
    <p>
        According to the DSM-V, which is the diagnostic tool used by professionals in the mental health field to identify disorders, 
        a depressive episode is defined by nine distinct criteria. For a person to be diagnosed they would need to meet at least five of the 
        criteria for at least two weeks.
